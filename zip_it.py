# Zip It
# Create a standalone function that accepts two lists and combines their values sequentially into a new list, at alternating indices starting with first list. 
# Extra values from either list should be included afterward. 
# Given [1,2] and [10,20,30,40], return new list containing [1,10,2,20,30,40].
#     Second: combine the two listâ€™s values into the first list, instead of into a new list. Much more fun!
